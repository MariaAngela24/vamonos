*¡Vámonos!* is a fullstack web application designed for planning an itinerary of events for groups of people travelling together. Integration of the Eventbrite API allows users to browse events happening across the globe, or find activities happening at their destination, during their travel dates. Users can add their friends, and automatically keep track of who wants to attend each event. Using the Twilio SMS API *¡Vámonos!* sends out text message reminders before the trip begins.

#### Version 2.0

###### Custom Notifications
I'd like to allow users to customize notification options, such that individualized text messages are sent out before certain events begin, or when trip details change, etc.

###### Google Calendar
In a future version, I'd want to integrate the Google Calendars API such that users could export the events from their itinerary directly to a Google Calendar, or import events from a Google Calendar onto their itinerary.    

###### Facebook Friends
I would like to incorporate the Facebook API, allowing users to login/signup through Facebook, and include their Facebook friends in their travel plans.
